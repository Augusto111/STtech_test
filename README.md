# STtech_test

This is a interview test of Sensetime. It will:
1. read all of the executable files from the gedit directory
2. execute these files according to alphabet order
3. if the executable file has the output, then print them to the terminal

## Usage
1. open the terminal
2. run :
```shell
python execution_exe.py [your target directory path]
```
###   Note

1. The code relys on the python3, so please pay attention to the version of your python.
2. This code can only run on Linux.
3. You can use the "targetDir" to test like:
```shell
